### CSS Grid
CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.    

`grid-template-column/row or areas` - you can use different grid templates to make your webpage more dynamic and easier to adjust.

`grid-template-column: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr))` - this will remove the whitespace on the the side of the items when you adjust the screen size of the webpage.

### Objects
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

`objectName.propertyName` - you can call the specific key on an object.

`objectName.propertyName = value` - instead of `pushing` a new value to an array. You can add a key into an object by assigning it like a variable.
